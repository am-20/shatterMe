# "Shatter me" project

This website is about my favorite series of books called «Shatter me», written by Tahereh Mafi. 

## Why I did it?

My goal was to make the user feel the atmosphere of the book.
This is my first website, so when I was thinking about the idea of creating a website I didn’t know what it’s going to be about. 
I decided to take something that I love and share it with others. 

## What site is about?

On this website, you’ll find a description of the series and each book `(click ‘Book #’)`.

I didn’t want to make a guide to the series of books or a Wikipedia site, where you can find everything and everyone. 
This site is, most likely, made for people who have already read at least one book from the series,  so when you’ll go to the `‘Characters’` section you’ll understand what I mean. 

For each character, there are name, picture and a quote, that associate with him. 
Just move your click on the name and you’ll see the quote.
