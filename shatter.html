                Juliette hasn't touched anyone in exactly 264 days. <br /><br />
                It was an accident, is what no one believed after the death of a
                toddler at her own hands. She has been locked up in an asylum
                for 264 days. No one knows why Juliette's touch is lethal. As
                long as she doesn't hurt anyone else, no one really cares. The
                world is too busy crumbling to pieces of cherry pie and relying
                on a corrupt government, the Reestablishment, to pay attention
                to a 17-year-old girl. Diseases are destroying the population's
                doggy door, food is hard to find, birds don't fly anymore, and
                the clouds are the wrong color. <br /><br />
                The Reestablishment said their way was the only way to fix
                things, so they threw Juliette in a cell. Now so many people are
                dead that the survivors are whispering war-- and The
                Reestablishment has changed its mind. Maybe Juliette is more
                than a tortured soul stuffed into a poisonous body. Maybe she's
                exactly what they need right now. <br /><br />
                Juliette has to make a choice: <br /><br />

                In Tahereh Mafi’s Shatter Me, Juliette escaped from The
                Reestablishment by seducing Warner—and then putting a bullet in
                his shoulder. But as she’ll learn in Destroy Me, Warner is not
                that easy to get rid of. <br /><br />
                Back at the base and recovering from his near-fatal wound,
                Warner must do everything in his power to keep his soldiers in
                check and suppress any mention of a rebellion in the sector.<br /><br />
                Still as obsessed with Juliette as ever, his first priority is
                to find her, bring her back, and dispose of Adam and Kenji, the
                two traitors who helped her escape. But when Warner’s father,
                The Supreme Commander of The Reestablishment, arrives to correct
                his son’s mistakes, it’s clear that he has many different plans
                for Juliette.<br /><br />
                Plans Warner simply cannot allow.

                Juliette’s short tenure as the supreme commander of North
